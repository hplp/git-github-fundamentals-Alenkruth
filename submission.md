Since I have been using Github for a long time now, the README of this repository felt like a quick revision.

I will **NOT** be creating personal README, atleast at this point of time since I already host my personal website with [github(github.io)](https://alenkruth.github.io) at [alenkruth.com](https://alenkruth.com) and I do not have the time to create a good personal README(I do not want to create one just for the sake of it). I might create a personal README down the line, but I am not sure.

Overall, I loved this course (Advanced Digital Logic Design). We were exposed to the newest tools in the EDA market, including open source tools.
I would like to see improved tutorials for this lab, since I found the collab part of it to be very unclear. I would also not encourage using google collab for assignements if students will have to use their personal EMAILs to login and use them.
